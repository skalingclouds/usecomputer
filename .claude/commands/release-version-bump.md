# /release-version-bump

Use this workflow when working on **release-version-bump** in `usecomputer`.

## Goal

Prepares and publishes a new release of the package, including version bump, changelog update, and npm package.json changes.

## Common Files

- `CHANGELOG.md`
- `package.json`

## Suggested Sequence

1. Understand the current state and failure mode before editing.
2. Make the smallest coherent change that satisfies the workflow goal.
3. Run the most relevant verification for touched files.
4. Summarize what changed and what still needs review.

## Typical Commit Signals

- Update CHANGELOG.md with new release notes.
- Update version in package.json.
- Commit changes with a 'release: usecomputer@X.Y.Z' message.
- Push to repository to trigger CI and publish.

## Notes

- Treat this as a scaffold, not a hard-coded script.
- Update the command if the workflow evolves materially.
